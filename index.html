                              三月的第一篇！今天是3月4日，这几天一直在找状态呀，很难，感觉有点不习惯。过几天就要正式搬到合租房了，那边条件似乎要更加艰苦一些，不过比宿舍强多了。
周一到周四每天都有一两堂课吊着，上不去下不来，卡在这儿了，很难受。
小组作业死ね！I タイプの人気持ちをちゃんと考えてくださいよ、お前は！

                              好久不见，今天算是正式步入正轨了www，也总算是在学校拥有了完整舒适的夜晚时光了哈哈。今天收到了30讲的书，开始听零基础了，希望能在五月中旬（不知道晚不晚）之前完成吧，真的很厚。
临时租的旅店感觉还不错，只不过窗帘透光，需要戴眼罩睡觉，目前还是不吵的，这个很好。
现在可以十一点睡觉了，第二天多半个小时看英语单词，nice。
体育课气排球感觉还是比较轻松正常的哦，在室内上，挺好，不过春季学期无所谓了。智能网络实验课也算正常吧，希望少占一些时间。
工作日桌子宽的教室太难找了，完全放不下笔记本电脑和书看课，难受哦。
随机到miku的兔子洞图，这种有好多hh，将来随机到的概率还是蛮大的，可爱滴捏。

                              KMP算法介绍KMP算法（Knuth-Morris-Pratt算法）是一种高效的字符串匹配算法，由D.E.Knuth、J.H.Morris和V.R.Pratt三位计算机科学家共同提出。
核心思想KMP算法的核心在于利用已经匹配过的部分信息，避免在匹配失败时重新从模式串的开头开始匹配。具体来说，当主串和模式串的某个字符不匹配时，KMP算法会根据模式串的部分匹配表(PMT表)来移动模式串，而不是像暴力匹配算法那样重新从模式串的开头开始匹配。
关键概念最长相同前后缀长度：从字符串左端开始，不同长度字符串的前缀与后缀交集中的最长的元素长度。
PMT：部分匹配表，储存了最长相同前后缀长度。
